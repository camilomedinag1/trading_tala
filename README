# Stock Trading App

A simple stock trading simulation app using Flask, React, and WebSockets.

## Installation

Start the application using Docker:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Usage

- The backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`
- The frontend is accessible at `http://localhost:3000`
- Use the interface to buy and sell stocks in real-time

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/stock/info` → Get current stock data
- `POST /api/stock/buy` → Buy stock (requires authentication)
- `POST /api/stock/sell` → Sell stock (requires authentication)

## Troubleshooting

- If `localhost` does not work, try using `127.0.0.1`
- Ensure Docker is running and ports `3000` and `5000` are available
